# Task Page Angular

## Introduction
This project is an Angular 19 application. It uses Bootstrap for styling.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or later)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) (version 12.x or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/eraldtorra/task-page-angular.git
    cd task-page-angular
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:
```sh
ng serve
## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
